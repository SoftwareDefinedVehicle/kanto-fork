We are living in an era of digitization, in which companies are reshaping their operations and innovating their business models by offering next generation connected products and digital services. Machines, consumer goods and vehicles are transforming into complex connected IoT devices with advanced software features, collecting and reacting on user insights and data in real-time in secure and safe way. 

Edge computing is shifting from hardware to software focusing on intelligent devices, edge platforms, edge applications and services. New connected products continuously increase in complexity to benefit AIoT â€“ be it built into the products or empowering the production lines. Building the products of the future such as connected vehicles and in vehicle cross-domain applications, connected appliances, smart buildings and connected manufacturing is becoming more and more complex and companies are losing time and money to build the common technologies by themselves, sometimes even lacking the right skills and expertise. 

We bring our knowledge and 20+ years of IoT and edge experience in the open source to enable true collaboration, technology co-development and co-innovation! We address the sheer complexity of edge software and hardware via open technology and ecosystem approach ensuring freedom of choice with vendor-neutral, independent jointly-developed software that goes at the heart of manufactured devices.
