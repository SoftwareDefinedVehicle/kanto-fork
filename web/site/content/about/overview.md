Eclipse Kantoâ„¢ is a modular IoT edge software that enables devices for IoT with all essentials like cloud connectivity, digital twins, local communication, container management, and software updates - all configurable and remotely manageable by an IoT cloud ecosystem of choice.


Eclipse Kanto makes it possible to deploy intelligence on the device so companies can get more value from diverse edge assets, process and act on IoT data right on the device and manage devices from the cloud. Device manufacturers can add new revenue streams with connected products and ensure agile development for hardware and software.


Using Eclipse Kanto, technology teams take advantage of configurable and reusable building blocks to connect the unconnected or build the edge applications for the next generation connected products and services.


Eclipse Kanto is specifically optimized for complex IoT devices facing limited hardware resources, (near) real-time requirements, diverse device software, heterogeneous data sources and the ability to operate without connection. This makes it a perfect technology for emerging paradigms such as software-defined vehicles, connected machines and connected manufacturing, smart appliances, smart buildings and more.
